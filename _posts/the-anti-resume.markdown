## why i'm sharing this
##### Sep 15th, 2024

[this](https://bones-ai.bearblog.dev/anti-resume/) post inspired by [this](https://iamyourboon.com/anti-resume/) post, inspired me to write **this** post. to collect all the professional and non-professional screw up's, what-if's, and why i sometimes suck or hold myself back.

enjoy.

## anti-resume

- Failed every single class in my first year of college and dropped out after. Didn't go back for years.

- Interviewed at a blockchain [gas](https://ethereum.org/en/gas/) reduction startup. Made it to the final 3 out of ~200+ candidates. Not hired on.

- Interviewed at Google. Passed all interviews. Hiring managers for multiple locations never ended up contacting me to fill the role.

- Tried to learn Golang. Gave up after one week. Learning C this time around a few years later. We'll see if it sticks.

*update*: It did not stick. Maybe I'll come back to this.

- Didn't really apply myself in high school, because "college is a scam anyways". Can't say i was wrong, but it's a necessary evil nowadays. I also refused to apply for scholarships because I'm lazy (and wasn't going to get a pell grant anytime soon).

- I let my crazy future aspirations cloud my judgement and realization that it takes consistent work, dedication, and planning to get there. But then again, who doesn't suffer from this.

- I constantly let my ego get in the way of doing things I know I need to do. Probably why i won't get on a dating app.

- I can't articulate myself too good.

*note*: This will remain a work in progress as I continue to make more bonehead moves in life.

## why it's important
It's important to take a step back from the constant LinkedIn, hustle bro, professional life facade and be honest with yourself. Let your mistakes be known. It'll bring your guard down and make you feel more human.
