## [BitSplitter](https://github.com/justinsautter/bitsplitter)
#### The CLI-based IP network subnet calculator
- Creates IPv4 subnets based off IP and CIDR mask notation
- Useful for creating subnets where internet-based calculators aren't available
    - Wrote for myself because I needed to reconfigure subnets on a network during a firewall migration
